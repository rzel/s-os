## About SoS ##
Sos is a small 32 bit operating system for the x86 archetecture. It was originally written in C and assembly.

I am planning to port the parts of the operating system written in C to C++. I will be uploading the new code as it is written. I hope to implement some basic filesystem and disk access support, and simple multasking in the new version. I also intend to port a C and C++ library to the OS, and create a cross compiler for it.

## Running SoS ##
Sos currently runs from a floppy disk, or from a CD. There is a CD iso of the new version of SoS available for download, but this only prints the line "Welcome to SoS version 0.0.1". The code is just as boring, as I have only just started re-writing it from scratch.

## Licencing ##
The new version of Sos is licensed under the BSD license.
