\chapter{Installing SoS}
SoS can be installed on a CD, Floppy disk, USB drive, or hard drive. If GRUB is already installed, then the
process is much simpler. You may not have to follow many of the steps below if this is already the case.

SoS will not in any way modify the contents of the media that you install it on, but if you do not install it
correctly, you may cause problems with your disks. Because of this, it's best to just burn it to a CD, or
use the CD-ROM iso in a virtual machine. Virtualbox and QEMU are the emulators that SoS is mainly tested on, and
both are available free of charge on the internet.

\section{Burning a CD image}
SoS is distributed as a CD-ROM iso image. In most operating systems it is very simple to burn an image to a disk,
but in some, like Microsoft Windows, you may need third party applications to do this.

If you want to run a modified version of SoS, you can build it from source and have the build system make an
image for you. This is not necessary for running the official SoS distribution.
