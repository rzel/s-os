\chapter{Applications}
\section{Seashell}
Seashell will is SoS's default terminal. Right now, the terminal is part of SoS's kernel, but after
I have finished porting the C library, and have an elf loader, it will become a seperate application.

Once SoS has a graphical user interface, a graphical version of Seashell will be written.

\section{GNU Compiler Collection}
Once SoS has a C library, I intend to port the whole GNU compiler collection to SoS. This will require
a standard C library to be ported first. Then, I will make a cross compiler for my operating system, and
compile GCC for it. 

This will make it easy to port various UNIX applications (like the nano text editor and Bash) to SoS. 

Before this though, I have a lot of work to do - I will have to finish memory management, write a VFS,
and write a device driver and filesystem support for CD-ROM drives. I don't know if I'm going to be able
to support USB drives for a long while, unless they act as emulated hard drives.
