\section{Applications}
\subsection{Seashell}
Seashell will be SoS's default terminal. Initially, the terminal will be compiled into the kernel, but after
I have finished porting the C library, and have an elf loader, it will become a seperate application.

Once SoS has a graphical user interface, a graphical version of Seashell will be written.
