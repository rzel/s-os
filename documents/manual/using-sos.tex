\chapter{Using SoS}

If you have SoS installed on a CD or on a USB drive, then to run it you simply have to put it in the drive of 
your computer, and start it up. When the BIOS starts (the first thing you see when you turn your computer on),
it may have something like 'Boot Menu: F12' displayed either along the bottom of the screen, or in the top
corner. Press the key it says, and you should get a list of drives on your computer. If you are booting from
CD, select 'CD-ROM Drive' or 'DVD-ROM drive' or similar, and press enter. If you are booting from USB, you want
'USB Device' or the like.

SoS will boot and display the start up log. The terminal is at the bottom of the screen.
