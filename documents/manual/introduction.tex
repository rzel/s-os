\section{Introduction}
SoS is a small operating system written in C++ and assembly. It is designed for 64 bit CPUs, like the
AMD Athlon and Intel Core series processors. Because the GRUB bootloader is used for booting SoS, it
can be run off a CD, floppy disk, hard drive or even a USB drive.

In the future, SoS will run a standard C and C++ library, as well as the GNU C compiler and associated
tools.
