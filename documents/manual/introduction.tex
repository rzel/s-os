\chapter{Introduction}
SoS is a small operating system written in C++ and assembly. SoS supports both the x86 and x86-64 archetectures.
This covers the vast majority of desktop and laptop computers available today.
Because the GRUB bootloader is used for booting SoS, it
can be run off a CD, floppy disk, hard drive or even a USB drive.

In the future, SoS will run a standard C and C++ library, as well as the GNU C compiler and associated
tools.

You can download a bootable CD image of SoS, or an archive of the SoS system files for installation 
onto other mediums like USB drives and hard disks. The GRUB bootloader is recommended for booting
SoS, but you can use any multiboot compatible one. There is a floppy disk image of SoS, but we recommend
you try one of the other mediums for testing.
